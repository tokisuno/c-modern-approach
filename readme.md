My solutions and notes for [978-0393979503](https://www.amazon.ca/Programming-Modern-Approach-K-King/dp/0393979504)

## Why I stopped reading this in the first place
For the very few of you that actually go through my github, you would know that I started this book a long time ago and then deleted the repo. My reasoning for that was simple: I was insecure. I didn't want to ask anyone questions in fear of being seen as stupid and lesser. I think pride and shame are two large obstacles that I am trying to overcome, but that's for another time. Overall I really enjoyed my time with C, and I think it's a very important language to learn. 

## Learning plan
I am still going to continue doing The Odin Project, but when I'm done my sessions for the day, I want something else to work on. It's an itch to learn that I always have, but I don't want to burn out of web development super quickly. It's just a little hobby/side project that hopefully I can make videos on in the future :3
