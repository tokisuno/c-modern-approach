Okay it's been a hot minute since I've done anything on this repo, but here I am again. I am finding it difficult trying to think about TheOdinProject while going through this term of university, and I have been getting more interested in daily driving dwm. So I want to get a little more familiar with C. There are still parts of C that I don't really understand that I would really like to, like pointers and strings. I also just got an ergo-split keyboard so I kind of feel like a hacker-man whenever I type, and since I'm not really doing anything else programming related I thought why not. LOL. To those who are stalking my github to see what I am up to, hey. I'm alive. I just underwent some more medical checks so I can hopefully get surgery sometime next year. My quality of life is slowly improving, which makes me hopeful for the future. I miss when I would make content and not feel utter dread and discomfort. That'll come with time, but I am having fun living right now :) I am surrounded by the right people and reaching a better place mentally.

That's the little update. C is pretty cool tho :p I deleted the last 2 chapters work because I don't remember what I did and I haven't really used C in a hot minute, so I'm going to run through them again to refresh myself. TOKISUNO 2.0 INCOMING

I just completed the TicTacToe assignment for TheOdinProject so I am back to having 2-3 lessons before the next assignment. I thought that since I finished it today, that I would spend some time going through this textbook for a little bit just so then I don't get too groggy with JavaScript. Maybe I should do the tictactoe assignment in C to see if I logically do it. Good sessions today and good work done overall.

C is a free-time language for when I am done my sessions or don't have enough time to start a new project while I am working through sessions.

I've devised a schedule so I can learn webdev quickly as well as still have fun programming. It goes as follows:

* Monday-Friday
    - 1hr of Japanese review
    - 5/6 hours of The Odin Project
* Saturday
    - Break day
* Sunday
    - Program in whatever I want
        * C
        * C++

I don't really want to go through burnout any time soon. I still (surprisingly) have a life outside of my computer so this gives me a healthy balance while still being (mostly) productive. I've been really hard on myself over these past few years but if I don't trust myself, I will never get anywhere.
