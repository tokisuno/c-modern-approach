I just completed the TicTacToe assignment for TheOdinProject so I am back to having 2-3 lessons before the next assignment. I thought that since I finished it today, that I would spend some time going through this textbook for a little bit just so then I don't get too groggy with JavaScript. Maybe I should do the tictactoe assignment in C to see if I logically do it. Good sessions today and good work done overall. 

C is a free-time language for when I am done my sessions or don't have enough time to start a new project while I am working through sessions.

I've devised a schedule so I can learn webdev quickly as well as still have fun programming. It goes as follows:

* Monday-Friday
    - 1hr of Japanese review
    - 5/6 hours of The Odin Project
* Saturday
    - Break day
* Sunday
    - Program in whatever I want 
        * C
        * C++

I don't really want to go through burnout any time soon. I still (surprisingly) have a life outside of my computer so this gives me a healthy balance while still being (mostly) productive. I've been really hard on myself over these past few years but if I don't trust myself, I will never get anywhere.
