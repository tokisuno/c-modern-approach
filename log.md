I've devised a schedule so I can learn webdev quickly as well as still have fun programming. It goes as follows:

* Monday-Friday
    - 1hr of Japanese review
    - 5/6 hours of The Odin Project
* Saturday
    - Break day
* Sunday
    - Program in whatever I want 
        * C
        * C++

I don't really want to go through burnout any time soon. I still (surprisingly) have a life outside of my computer so this gives me a healthy balance while still being (mostly) productive. I've been really hard on myself over these past few years but if I don't trust myself, I will never get anywhere.
